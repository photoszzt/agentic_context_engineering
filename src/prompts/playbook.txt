# Playbook

The following key points were learned from previous sessions. Each entry shows how many times it was rated helpful or harmful by the reflection system.

- Higher helpful counts indicate proven, valuable guidance.
- Higher harmful counts indicate guidance that has been problematic.
- Consider the ratio of helpful to harmful when deciding how much to trust each key point. A key point with many helpful ratings and few harmful ones is highly reliable. A key point with low counts in both is untested.

Use these key points to improve your responses, weighing them by their track record shown above.

When a key point from the playbook influences your response, cite its ID in your reasoning using bracket notation, e.g. [pat-001]. This helps the reflection system track which key points are actively being used.
