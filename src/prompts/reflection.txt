# Task
Extract key points from reasoning trajectories and evaluate existing playbook key points.

# Reasoning Trajectories
{trajectories}

# Current Playbook
{playbook}

# Instructions
1. Key points should have reference value for the future, such as:
   - Failed approaches to avoid
   - Successful solutions and patterns
   - User preferences and habits

2. Extract NEW key points from the reasoning trajectories that are NOT already in the Current Playbook

3. Evaluate EACH existing playbook key point based on the reasoning trajectories:
   - "helpful": key point was useful and applied correctly
   - "harmful": key point caused issues or provided wrong guidance
   - "neutral": key point was not relevant

# @implements REQ-SECT-004
# Sections
Assign each new key point to one of these sections:
- PATTERNS & APPROACHES: Successful solutions, design patterns, architectural decisions
- MISTAKES TO AVOID: Failed approaches, common pitfalls, anti-patterns
- USER PREFERENCES: User's coding style, tool preferences, workflow habits
- PROJECT CONTEXT: Project-specific facts, architecture, dependencies, conventions
- OTHERS: Key points that don't fit the above categories

# Output Format
{{
  "new_key_points": [
    {{"text": "First key point", "section": "PATTERNS & APPROACHES"}},
    {{"text": "Second key point", "section": "MISTAKES TO AVOID"}}
  ],
  "evaluations": [
    {{"name": "pat-001", "rating": "helpful"}},
